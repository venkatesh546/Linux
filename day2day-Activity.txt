I have already installed and configured VMware ESXi 6.7 on multiple physical servers. During installation, I assigned static IP addresses, usernames, and passwords for VMware web login.
Each server is equipped with an 8-port network card. I configured virtual switches with two interfaces per switch, resulting in a total of 4 virtual switches. Each virtual switch has been assigned a specific VLAN.
These VLANs are configured in the FortiGate 200F firewall as DMZ1, DMZ2, DMZ3, and LAN-MAIN. As per requirements, we have assigned IP addresses to the VMs for the specific VLANs."
Installed virtual machines with RHEL 8.x, CentOS 6.x/7.x/8.x, and Ubuntu. Configured static IP addresses to enable SSH access.
Managed and configured various servers, including NFS, SFTP, NTP, FTP, vHost, Nginx Proxy and Nginx Tcp load balancing, monitoring tools, and custom applications.
