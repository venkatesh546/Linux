Domain Name Server Configuration in RHEL 8 (CentOS 8):
======
DNS is a service that helps to resolve a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) into an IP address and additionally, perform a reverse translation- translation of an IP address to a user-friendly domain name.

Step 1: Install bind DNS packages.
dnf install bind bind-utils

Start the DNS server using the command below:
systemctl start named

Next, enable it so that it can kick in even after a reboot
systemctl enable named

Just to be sure that the service is running as expected, check its status
systemctl status named

Step 2:  Configure bind DNS server
Let’s take a backup of the config file  /etc/named.conf
cp /etc/named.conf  /etc/named.bak

Now go ahead and open the file using your preferred text editor.
vim /etc/named.conf

Under the ‘Options’  section, ensure you comment out the lines indicated below to enable the Bind DNS server to listen to all IPs.

// listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; }; 
// listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; };

Additionally, locate the allow-query parameter and adjust it according to your network subnet.

allow-query { localhost; 192.168.1.0/24; };

This setting allows only the hosts in the defined network to access the DNS server and not just any other host.

To define the reverse and forward lookup zones, copy and paste the following configuration at the end of /etc/named.conf

//forward zone
zone "nehraclasses.local" IN {
     type master;
     file "nehraclasses.local.db";
     allow-update { none; };
     allow-query { any; };
};

//backward zone
zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
     type master;
     file "nehraclasses.local.rev";
     allow-update { none; };
     allow-query { any; };
};

Step 3: Create a forward DNS zone file for the domain

vim /var/named/nehraclasses.local.db
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA primary-dns.nehraclasses.local. admin.nehraclasses.local. (
                                                2020011800 ;Serial
                                                3600 ;Refresh
                                                1800 ;Retry
                                                604800 ;Expire
                                                86400 ;Minimum TTL
)

;Name Server Information
@ IN NS primary-dns.nehraclasses.local.

;IP Address for Name Server
primary-dns IN A 192.168.1.115

;Mail Server MX (Mail exchanger) Record
nehraclasses.local. IN MX 10 mail.nehraclasses.local.

;A Record for the following Host name
www  IN   A   192.168.1.50
mail IN   A   192.168.1.60

;CNAME Record
ftp  IN   CNAME www.nehraclasses.local.


Step 4: Create a reverse DNS zone file for the domain

vim /var/named/nehraclasses.local.rev
$TTL 86400
@ IN SOA primary-dns.nehraclasses.local. admin.nehraclasses.local. (
                                            2020011800 ;Serial
                                            3600 ;Refresh
                                            1800 ;Retry
                                            604800 ;Expire
                                            86400 ;Minimum TTL
)
;Name Server Information
@ IN NS primary-dns.nehraclasses.local.
primary-dns     IN      A       192.168.1.115

;Reverse lookup for Name Server
35 IN PTR primary-dns.nehraclasses.local.

;PTR Record IP address to Hostname
50      IN      PTR     www.nehraclasses.local
60      IN      PTR     mail.nehraclasses.local

Next, assign the necessary file permissions to the two configuration files.
chown named:named /var/named/nehraclasses.local.db
chown named:named /var/named/nehraclasses.local.rev

To confirm that the DNS zone lookup files are free from any syntactical errors, run the commands shown:

named-checkconf
named-checkzone nehraclasses.local /var/named/nehraclasses.local.db
named-checkzone 192.168.1.115 /var/named/nehraclasses.local.rev

For the changes to be reflected in the system, restart the Bind DNS server

systemctl restart named

Add Firewall Rule.

firewall-cmd  --add-service=dns --zone=public  --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

Step 5: Test the Bind DNS server from a client system

vim /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.115

vim /etc/sysconfig/networkk-scripts/ifcfg-ens033
DNS=192.168.1.115

systemctl restart NetworkManager

Using the nslookup command test the Bind DNS server as shown:

nslookup primary-dns.nehraclasses.local
nslookup mail.nehraclasses.local
nslookup www.nehraclasses.local
nslookup ftp.nehraclasses.local
nslookup 192.168.1.115


The output from the nslookup command confirms that the forward DNS lookup is working as expected.

Moreover, you can also use the dig command as shown

dig primary-dns.nehraclasses.local

To perform a reverse DNS lookup, use the dig command as shown:

dig -x 192.168.1.115

Perfect! The reverse DNS lookup is also working as we would expect.
